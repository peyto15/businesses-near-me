# businesses-near-me
Find up to 60 businesses near you!

This is a locally run Python tool that uses Google's Place & Address Validation APIs to find up to 60 businesses of a specific type (cafe, gas station, dentist, etc.) within a radius of 30 miles or less of a specific address. The limitations mentioned here come from the limitations of the APIs themselves, and that's probably a good thing considering how high of a bill these APIs can run someone.

You will need your own Google API key for this tool, and that requires a billing account set up in Google Cloud Platform. HOWEVER, you will get $200 in free credits per month. That should cover you for many runs of this tool. Further, when you set up a billing account it automatically sets up budget alerts for you. Read more about getting your owen API key here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/cloud-setup. You will only need to follow the "Enable Billing" and "Enable APIs" sections. All you will need from this is your API key itself.
